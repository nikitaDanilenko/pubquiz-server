# Readme

This program consitutes a REST backend for the quiz service.
It handles various commands corresponding to creating, updating, and locking quizzes.
There is no deletion option, for future comparability, 
but deletion can be usually handled manually by someone with access to the actual files.

## Features

1. Creating new quizzes creates empty point pages for the whole quiz, and the individual groups.
   It also handles the entry on the main front page, 
   where all quizzes listed in the quiz directory are presented for future reference.

1. Upon quiz creation, the server also creates two PDF files.

   1. The main file is the sheet for the actual answers provided by the groups.
      The document is optimised for two-sided printing, and empty pages are inserted,
      when the number of pages is not a multiple of four.
      Additionally, the answer sheets contain a QR code with a link to the individual point page
      of the team.
      There is also some room for a team name, which can be entered by the moderator.

   1. The secondary document is a file containing only the QR codes.
      This document is intended for cases where users may have missed the use of the
      quiz management application,
      or when there are good reasons for using only individual sheets,
      and not the ones generated by the application.

### Usability

The usual workflow should consist of the following steps.



1. When you create a new quiz, a sheet for the regular rounds is automatically created.
   This sheet contains the QR codes to quickly get to the corresponding sites.
   To get the sheet, you need `pdflatex` with some standard libraries,
   and `qrencode`.
   Both tools are available free of charge under Ubuntu.
   If either of these is missing, you will get a corresponding failure message and 
   no quiz sheet will be created.
   If both tools exist, you will get a link to the path on the quiz editing page.

### Technology

1. Sensitive REST requests (i.e. posts) are secured by HMAC.
   This means that you cannot arbitrarily manipulate the quizzes,
   because you need a session key, which is only delivered upon login.
   You can, however, resend a previous update to post an earlier state,
   if you manage a man in the middle scenario.
   Still, this might prove difficult, if the connection is encrypted.
